Follow instructions provided in googledoc.api-setup.pdf.

Your Google Doc ID will go in the provided space at the top of server.js.
That will be the ID of the page where your IP will be written by openDraught so you can keep
track of what your local IP address for the machine this is running on.

Then you'll download your credentials JSON from google and name it credentials.json and put it in
this directory that this readme is currently in.
